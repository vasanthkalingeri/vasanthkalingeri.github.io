title: About me
---

I enjoy constructing abstractions of the world using probabilistic models and distilling them into usable well designed code. In short, I am a Machine Learning Researcher/Engineer.

Currently, as a Senior Data Scientist at Wise.io, I build machine learning applications to analyze vast amounts of sensor data and provide value to various business units accross General Electric. Prior to this, I worked on Deep Learning and Probabilistic models as a Master's student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Before my Master's, I built a variety of software products as a freelancer throughout my undergraduate at SJCE, Mysore.
